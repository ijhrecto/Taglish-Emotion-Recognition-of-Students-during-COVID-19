1. taken from tweeter with keywords relating to words such as 'aral'(study), 'school', 'online class', 'COVID-19' which consists of Taglish (tagalog-english) tweets.
2. clean tweets -> translate
3. two sampling methods: oversampling with text augmentation, and undersampling
4. WordNet-Affect to annotate the emotions
## Models
- 100-d Glove word embedding
- Support Vector Machine, Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes, and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit with Attention mechanism
- compares SVM and BNB (commonly used algorithm for Tagalog Emotion Recognition) to a Neural network with attention mechanism
